Since 2003 I've been dedicated to analysis and software development.

I started my career working in a small software house, there I was involved with all stages of software engineering: requirements analysis, development of software, training and support.

After that, I've worked in a multi-national company with more than 5000 employees, and leader in Latin America, I had the opportunity to improve all my acquired technical knowledge, I was directly involved with innovation and leadership with my co-workers and large clients.

Today I'm working as Senior Java Consultant for different segments companies.

As a autodidact, I specialize quickly into new technologies and methodologies to ensure the best performance and quality in project development.

I always give my best, and often I'm asked to solve critical problems and to share my knowledge through training.

I am interested in innovation, entrepreneurship, analysis and systems development coupled with agile methodologies.
